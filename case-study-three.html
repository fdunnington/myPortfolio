              <h1>Small changes for big impact</h1>
              <p>FlexiTog, a leading European supplier of cold-temperature protective workwear, were looking to improve their website's user experience and conversion rate. The company operates in the B2B market, but recent expansion into B2C raised questions about the user experience.</p>              
              <img class="mobile-image horizontal-image-scroll" src="assets/img/gallery/FlexiTog Casestudy.png">
              
              <h2>The challenge</h2>
              <p>Many of the company's business customers worked from brochures and product codes, using the site search functionality to put together their orders. The increase in direct consumer traffic who were browsing for products in a more traditional way highlighted some sticking points.</p>
              <p>The team at FlexiTog were concerned that users were finding the primary navigation confusing, harming conversion rates.Â To address this, they planned to design and build a new navigation for the website. They reached out to me to confirm their decision before committing to this potentially resource-intensive solution.</p>

              <h2>The solution: re-evaluating the problem</h2>
              <p>We started by analysing the website data to assess the existing navigation's effectiveness. Contrary to expectations, the data showed no significant friction. To pinpoint the real issues, we delved deeper and found B2C users were taking a long time to reach their target, were frequently sidetracked, and often abandoned the purchase process mid-flow.</p>
              <p>While encouraging users to explore the product range is important, we wanted to prioritise an easier path to the intended target. Without data to back up the theory of problematic primary navigation, we opted to test simpler solutions that could be implemented in-house.</p>
              <img class="mobile-image" src="assets/img/gallery/FlexiTog.png">
              <p>A task list was put in place, prioritising changes we felt would be most impactful. Our first step was to reduce the height of the hero sections on the FlexiTog website. These full-height sections acted as visual blockades, leaving users stuck above the fold. By reducing their height and moving category navigational aids higher up the page we provided an easy route. FlexiTog provides workwear, and users are generally looking for specific items, so funnelling by category felt like a natural choice.
                We made several other small changes, from moving product filters and pagination to more visible locations to changing the wording of related product sections to make it clearer what they were offering.</p>
              <p>With the expansion into B2C has come an increase in mobile traffic. The site, though responsive, was ultimately built from a desktop user perspective. On smaller screens, it felt overcrowded and lacking in clear direction. To address this, we worked on a plan for de-cluttering the mobile version, slimming down the content, and changing the element behaviour for better user experience (such as implementing horizontal scrolls for product categories).</p>            
              <h2>The outcome</h2>
              <p>The implemented changes were highly successful. Conversion rates rose significantly, indicating a much smoother buying experience. We also saw a decrease in u-turns, suggesting that users were finding what they needed more easily. User engagement increased, and the average number of clicks required to reach the shopping cart went down.</p>
