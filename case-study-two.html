                    <h1>Using Object-Oriented UX and ORCA to manage content migration</h1>

                    <p>Object-oriented UX (OOUX) is a design philosophy consolidated by Sophia Prater in 2015 which builds on long-established principles of information processing and applies them in a design environment. The ORCA (Objects, Relationships, Calls to Action, and Attributes) process is how you can achieve it.</p>
    
                    <p>The goal? To re-frame the design process in the user's mental model. And what on earth does that mean? It essentially means finding the objects (nouns) that users use to describe an environment and building a framework around those.</p>
    
                    <p>Why? Well, it's commonly accepted that humans process environments in terms of the objects within them and the relationships between those objects. Traditionally, digital design starts with verbs - what actions are our users trying to take, and how do we facilitate those. But what do those actions mean if we're not clear on the objects those actions are being taken on? Your users want to wash something? Wash what? If we haven't established the 'what' - the object - first, then how do we know the best way to help them complete the action they want to complete? Washing your hair isn't the same process as washing your car.</p>
    
                    <p>So, we've established why it makes sense to use an object-orientated approach. Let's take a look at the process in action, using it to migrate a content-heavy site from WordPress to LocalGov Drupal.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Establishing the objects of our user's affection</h2>
                    <p>Every environment, every website, every company - all have their own set of objects. Sure, there might be a lot of commonalities within similar spaces, but they're unlikely to be identical. For this reason, it's key to find out what these objects are before you do anything else.</p>
                    
                    <p>How do we do this? By hunting for the nouns (a process known in OOUX as 'noun foraging'). It makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Find the words users use to describe an environment and build a framework around them. This means all users - not just customers. Mission statements, customer feedback, talking to stakeholders - there's no limit on where you can get this data. If everyone uses the same nouns to describe the same things, we have a common understanding.</p>
                    <div class="portfolio-image-container">
                        <img class="full-width-portfolio-image" src="assets/img/gallery/Noun foraging.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>The objects we identified for our content migration project were subjects, guides, articles, contacts, documents, and resources (the website is an informational resource for a non-profit organisation in the legal sector).</p>
                </div>
                <div> 
                    <h2>Objects identified - what now??</h2>
                    <p>Through a series of processes, we establish relationships between the objects in the environment we are creating and head off on a voyage of discovery to understand how users might interact with the objects around them.</p>
                    
                    <p>Lost? No worries - it can seem mind-boggling at first, but let's look at it in the context of our content migration project.</p>
                    
                    <p>We had our objects. Next, we needed to work out the relationships between them. What did a topic mean to someone reading an article - what interactions might they be expecting to be able to take? And what was an article to someone on a topic page, or a subject to someone looking at a resource? All this requires a clear understanding of what your objects are. When you have that, you can see how objects relate to one another, and what actions users might expect to be able to take on an object. This is the start of building an intuitive navigation.</p>
                    
                    <p>With me again? Great!

                <div>
                    <h2>Should we just keep doing things the way we've always done them?</h2>
                    <p>...was a question asked by the project lead. All this OOUX seemed like an awful lot of effort.</p>
                    
                    <p>We could absolutely have carried on doing things as they'd been done before, but if that 'norm' starts with the verbs, then things are probably going to be way more complicated than they need to be. Complication Costs. Lives (actually, it costs money, but it is an added stress that no project needs).</p>
                    
                    <p>Aside from helping us design and develop a great user experience, following an object-focused process has other benefits:
                    
                    <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-start">Less guesswork = less risk</li> 
                        <p>Using an object-orientated approach and OOUX's ORCA process you quickly establish any unknowns and minimise chances that something gets missed. Knowing exactly what you're dealing with allows you to make better decisions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="list-start">Greater clarity = reduced cost</span>
                        <p>If everyone's on the same page (objects agreed on) then projects can move forward more freely. It's also great from a product development perspective, as developers generally adhere to object-orientated methods. If everyone works with objects then we're all on the same page, and your dev team don't have to unpick designs to get started. This can save a lot of money.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="list-start">Greater clarity = scalability</span>
                        <p>Object-orientated design is modular by nature, and modular design is fast, flexible, and scalable. Objects can be reused, and developers can add new features and modify existing ones without affecting the entire codebase.</p>
                    </li>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>So, how did this process inform the re-design and migration of our content-heavy public resource?</h2>
                    <p>Well, you've done well to bear with me this long (although hopefully it's been insightful too), so I'll treat you to an abridged version of why it was so important for this project.</p>
    
                    <ol>
                    <li class="list-bullet">It helped us quickly and effectively identify what we were migrating (including the relationships between objects), and how that mapped to Local Gov Drupal's more rigid content types.</li>
                    <li class="list-bullet">It allowed us to easily identify gaps in content and weed out redundant content.</li>
                    <li class="list-bullet">It forced us to produce modular, scaleable content. Why was this so important? Because future teams of content writers and developers would have an easy task updating content and introducing new features.</li>
                    <li class="list-bullet">It kept everyone - stakeholders, designers, developers - on the same page throughout the project. One big, happy family.</li>
